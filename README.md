# My Data Science Projects - ledger-phonix
This repository contains some data science projects I've been working on, focusing on practical applications of machine learning and data analysis.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🌸 Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploration

* **Goal:** Learn basic data handling and visualization with a classic dataset.
* **What I did:**
    * Loaded the Iris flower dataset.
    * Handled any potential missing data (though often clean).
    * Created visualizations (like box plots) to understand the distribution of sepal/petal dimensions across different species.
* **Skills practiced:** Data loading, basic cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization.
* **Files:** `iris_data_analysis.ipynb` (or whatever your notebook is named for this task), relevant CSV files in `DataSets/`.

### 📊 Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction

* **Goal:** Predict if a customer will default on a loan.
* **What I did:**
    * Loaded the loan prediction dataset.
    * Cleaned missing data (filled in gaps).
    * Looked at graphs for loan amount, education, and income.
    * Trained a Logistic Regression model to make predictions.
    * Checked how well the model worked using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
* **Skills practiced:** Data cleaning, EDA, categorical encoding, binary classification, model evaluation.
* **Files:** `loan_prediction_analysis.ipynb` (or whatever your notebook is named), relevant CSV files in `DataSets/`.

### 📊 Task 3: churn-prediction-analysis

* **Goal:** Identify bank customers who are likely to leave (churn).
* **What I did:**
    * Loaded and prepared the customer churn dataset.
    * Dropped irrelevant columns (`RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`).
    * Converted text data (like 'Geography' and 'Gender') into numbers for the model (One-Hot Encoding).
    * Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict if a customer will churn.
    * Analyzed which factors (like Age, Credit Score, Active Member status) were most important in predicting churn.
* **Skills practiced:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, categorical encoding, binary classification, feature importance analysis.
* **Files:** `churn_prediction_analysis.ipynb` (or whatever your notebook is named), relevant CSV files in `DataSets/`.

## 🛠️ Tools Used:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (for data handling)
* NumPy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for charts)
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
